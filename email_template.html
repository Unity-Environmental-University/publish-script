<p>Hello,</p>
<p>My name is {creator[name]} and I'm the {creator[role]} who is preparing your course to run this term. Your course section(s) of {code} has/have been created for you to teach for {term[name]}. Your students only have access to the syllabus and homepage. Actual course assignments will become available to the students on Monday {term[start]}, the official start of the term.  
<ul>
	<li>Please do not make any corrections or changes to your live course yourself, no matter how small. In order to maintain consistency between the live section and the course template, submit any issues via the Course Edit and Feedback Form so a Learning Technology Support Specialist can make sure the changes are made everywhere they need to be made.</li>
	<li>Let me know, when you have a chance to look, if you have any questions, or spot any issues with the course content.</li>
	<li>Be sure to check out the Instructor Orientation for useful information, such as your instructor bio/picture, grading. There is also a Labster Instructor Guide that you should review if your course contains a Labster simulation(s) in the course modules.</li>
	<li>Consult the Instructor Guide in your course for a brief overview of important information for teaching the course</li>
	<li>If you have technology or Canvas related questions, please contact helpdesk@unity.edu.</li>
	<li>For other questions or issues, please contact my supervisor, Chris Malmberg (cmalmberg@unity.edu).</li>
</ul>
<p>We appreciate your help in making sure these courses are good to go. Have a wonderful term.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>{creator[name]}</p>
