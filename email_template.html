<p>Hello,</p>
<p>My name is {creator[name]} and I'm the {creator[role]} who is preparing your course to run this term. Your course section(s) of {code} have been created for you to teach for {term[name]}.Your students will have access to the syllabus and homepage on [[Month, Day]]. Actual course assignments will become available to the students on Monday {term[start]}, the official start of the term.
<ul>
	<li>Please do not make any corrections or changes to your live course yourself, no matter how small. In order to maintain consistency between the live section and the course template, submit any issues via the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeybl9b-xk-pL1bsWX7x9esQYoHHyi3rPPOq75mK4Q4n4b5tQ/viewform">Course Edit and Feedback Form</a> so a Learning Technology Support Specialist can make sure the changes are made everywhere they need to be made.</li> 
	<li>Let me know, when you have a chance to look, if you have any questions, or spot any issues with the course content.</li>
	<li>Be sure to check out the Instructor Orientation for useful information, such as your instructor bio/picture, grading. There is also a <a href="https://unity.instructure.com/courses/3014024/pages/labster-instructor-guide">Labster Instructor Guide</a> that you should review if your course contains a Labster simulation(s) in the course modules.</li>
	<li>Consult the Instructor Guide in your course for a brief overview of important information for teaching the course</li>
	<li>If you have technology or Canvas related questions, please contact <a href="mailto:helpdesk@unity.edu">helpdesk@unity.edu</a></li> 
	For other questions or issues, please contact my supervisor, Chris Malmberg (<a href=mailto:cmalmberg@unity.edu>cmalmberg@unity.edu</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>You'll notice that the courses appear different than they have in the past. This new format will look different but should not impact how you interact with your course and/or students. There are no changes to Canvas Inbox, announcements, the gradebook, or SpeedGrader. For a more comprehensive overview of the new style, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_WxmgDgM2LcJe4gV7rZ1tHqy9dV9LMa_3BsK1ZfSN5Y">review this announcement</a>.</p>

<p><strong>While we prepare our old courses to run in this new format for the next few terms, you may see some edits to those courses shortly before term starts, as we get each ready for the first time it runs in the new format. This includes banner images on course pages.</strong></p>
<p>We appreciate your help in making sure these courses are good to go. Have a wonderful term.</p>
<p>Cheers,<br/>
{creator[name]}</p>
